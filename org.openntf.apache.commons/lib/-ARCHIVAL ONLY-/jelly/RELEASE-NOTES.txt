The Jakarta Commons Jelly team is pleased to announce the commons-jelly 1.0 release! 

http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/

Jelly is a Java and XML based scripting engine. Jelly combines the best ideas 
from JSTL, Velocity, DVSL, Ant and Cocoon all together in a simple yet 
powerful scripting engine. 

This is the first stable release of Jelly. It can be used as a standalone application
to run scripts, or incorporated into your Java applications.

Notable changes since the 1.0-RC1 release:
- Internal caching was changed to remove a memory leak
- Jelly is now distributed as an application with its dependencies and main tag libraries

Have fun!
-The Jelly team
